# Installation

Currently, **Docli requires Go version 1.13 or greater**. You can install Docli with a single command using `go get`, the Go package manager. Type this into your terminal:

{{<highlight bash>}}
$ go get -u github.com/celicoo/docli/v2@latest
{{</highlight>}}

Don't have Go installed? [Learn how to install Go here](https://golang.org/doc/install).
