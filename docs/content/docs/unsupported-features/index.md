# Unsupported features

Right now, Docli doesn't support the following features:

* Bash autocomplete
* Default values
* Global arguments
* Intelligent suggestions
* Positional arguments

If you absolutely need either one of those features, we recommend these [alternative libraries](https://github.com/avelino/awesome-go#command-line).
