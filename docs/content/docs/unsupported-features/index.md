# Unsupported features

Right now, Docli doesn't support the following features:

* Bash autocomplete
* Default values
* Global arguments
* Intelligent suggestions
* Positional arguments

If you need either one of those features, we recommend you to check out [awesome-go#standard-cli](https://github.com/avelino/awesome-go#standard-cli).
