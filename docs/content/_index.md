Welcome to the official Docli documentation. This documentation will teach you how to use Docli on your next project.

## What is Docli?

Docli is a declarative language for describing command-line interfaces in Go programs. It cuts down the boilerplate to the very minimum, so you can move on to the reason why you’re making the app in the first place.

Docli is 100% inspired on [docopt](https://github.com/docopt/docopt.go).

## Getting started

The easiest way to get started with Docli is following the [Tutorial]({{< relref "/docs/tutorial" >}}). To make the most out of it you should have a working knowledge of:

- [Errors](https://gobyexample.com/errors)
- [Pointers](https://gobyexample.com/pointers)
- [Structs](https://gobyexample.com/structs)

Good luck.
