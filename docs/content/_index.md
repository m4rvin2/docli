Welcome to the official Docli documentation. Here you'll learn how to use Docli for your next project.

## What is Docli?

Docli is a declarative language for describing command-line interfaces in Go programs. It cuts down the boilerplate to the bare minimum so you're free to move on to the actual reason you're making the app in the first place.

Docli is 100% inspired by [docopt](https://github.com/docopt/docopt.go).

## Getting started

The easiest way to get started with Docli is by following the [Tutorial]({{< relref "/docs/tutorial" >}}). To make the most out of it, you should have a working knowledge of:

- [Errors](https://gobyexample.com/errors)
- [Interfaces](https://gobyexample.com/interfaces)
- [Pointers](https://gobyexample.com/pointers)
- [Structs](https://gobyexample.com/structs)

Good luck.
